# Gift Card System Implementation

## Overview
The gift card system has been successfully implemented in the POS (Point of Sale) system. This allows customers to purchase gift cards and redeem them for purchases.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Gift Card Management
- **Purchase Gift Cards**: Create new gift cards with custom amounts
- **Redeem Gift Cards**: Search and redeem gift cards for purchases
- **Transaction History**: View all gift card transactions
- **Balance Tracking**: Real-time balance updates
- **Card Validation**: Verify gift card status and balance

### 2. Database Structure
The system uses two main tables:

#### `gift_cards` Table
```sql
- id: UUID (Primary Key)
- card_number: VARCHAR(50) (Unique)
- initial_amount: DECIMAL(10,2)
- current_balance: DECIMAL(10,2)
- is_active: BOOLEAN
- issued_by: UUID (References auth.users)
- issued_at: TIMESTAMP
- expires_at: TIMESTAMP (Optional)
- created_at: TIMESTAMP
```

#### `gift_card_transactions` Table
```sql
- id: UUID (Primary Key)
- gift_card_id: UUID (References gift_cards)
- transaction_type: VARCHAR(50) ('purchase', 'redemption', 'refund')
- amount: DECIMAL(10,2)
- order_id: UUID (References sales_orders, Optional)
- processed_by: UUID (References auth.users)
- created_at: TIMESTAMP
```

### 3. API Functions
The following functions are available in `src/lib/posApi.ts`:

#### Core Functions
- `createGiftCard(cardData)`: Create a new gift card
- `getGiftCard(cardNumber)`: Retrieve gift card by number
- `updateGiftCardBalance(cardId, newBalance)`: Update card balance
- `recordGiftCardTransaction(transactionData)`: Record a transaction
- `getGiftCardTransactions(cardId)`: Get transaction history

#### Business Logic Functions
- `redeemGiftCard(cardNumber, amount, orderId?)`: Redeem gift card for purchase
- `purchaseGiftCard(amount, customerId?)`: Purchase a new gift card

### 4. UI Components

#### GiftCardManager Component
Located at `src/components/pos/GiftCardManager.tsx`

**Features:**
- **Redeem Tab**: Search and redeem gift cards
- **Purchase Tab**: Create new gift cards
- **History Tab**: View transaction history
- **Real-time Validation**: Check card status and balance
- **Print Functionality**: Print gift card details
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Copy card numbers

**UI Elements:**
- Card search with validation
- Balance display with visual indicators
- Transaction history with icons
- Success/error notifications
- Responsive design with glass morphism

### 5. POS Integration

#### Cart Integration
- Gift card redemptions appear as negative amounts in cart
- Gift card purchases appear as positive amounts
- Automatic total calculation includes gift cards

#### Payment Processing
- Gift cards can be used as payment method
- Balance validation prevents over-redemption
- Transaction recording for audit trail

- User authentication required for all operations
- Audit trail for all transactions
- Balance validation prevents fraud

## Technical Implementation

### Error Handling
- Invalid card numbers

- Efficient balance calculations
- Minimal API calls
- Responsive UI updates

### Security Measures
- Input validation
- SQL injection prevention
- User authentication
- Transaction logging
- Balance verification

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Bulk Gift Card Creation**: Create multiple cards at once
2. **Gift Card Templates**: Predefined amounts and designs
3. **Email Delivery**: Send gift cards via email
4. **SMS Notifications**: Notify customers of balance changes
5. **Analytics Dashboard**: Gift card usage statistics
6. **Expiration Management**: Automatic expiration handling
7. **Refund Processing**: Handle gift card refunds
8. **Customer Portal**: Allow customers to check balances online

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Loyalty Program**: Link gift cards to loyalty points
2. **Marketing Campaigns**: Gift card promotions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Gift Card Not Found
- Verify card number is correct
- Check if card is active
- Ensure card hasn't expired

#### Insufficient Balance
- Check current balance
- Verify redemption amount
- Consider partial redemption

#### Transaction Errors
- Check database connection
- Verify user permissions
- Review error logs

### Debug Information
- All API calls are logged
- Transaction details are stored
- Error messages are user-friendly
- Console logs available for debugging

## Database Setup

The gift card tables are already included in the POS setup scripts:
- `setup_pos_tables.sql`
- `fix_pos_tables.sql`
- `fix_pos_tables_v2.sql`

Run these scripts to ensure the database structure is properly set up.

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Create a gift card with a test amount
2. Try redeeming the card for various amounts
3. Verify balance updates correctly
4. Check transaction history
5. Test error conditions (invalid card, insufficient balance)

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for API functions
- Integration tests for UI components
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
