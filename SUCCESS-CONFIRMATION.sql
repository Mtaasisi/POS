-- SUCCESS CONFIRMATION - 400 ERRORS FIXED
-- Your sales data is now loading successfully with customer information

-- ✅ CONFIRMED WORKING QUERIES:
-- The following queries are now working without 400 errors:

-- 1. Sales with Customer Information (WORKING)
SELECT 
    s.id,
    s.sale_number,
    s.customer_id,
    s.total_amount,
    s.payment_method,
    s.status,
    s.created_at,
    s.customer_name,
    s.customer_phone
FROM lats_sales s
ORDER BY s.created_at DESC;

-- 2. Sales Summary (WORKING)
SELECT 
    status,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    SUM(total_amount) as total_amount
FROM lats_sales 
GROUP BY status;

-- ✅ DATA ANALYSIS FROM YOUR RESULTS:

-- Sales Summary:
-- - Total Sales: 3 completed sales
-- - Total Revenue: 1,400,100 TSH
-- - All sales are "completed" status

-- Payment Methods Found:
-- - CRDB Bank: 700,000 TSH (JSON format)
-- - Cash: 700,000 TSH (JSON format)
-- - Cash: 100 TSH (Simple format)

-- Customer Information:
-- - Successfully retrieved customer names and phone numbers
-- - Mix of customer and non-customer sales
-- - No more 400 errors when fetching customer details

-- ✅ PAYMENT METHOD ANALYSIS:

-- JSON Format Payments:
-- 1. CRDB Bank: {"type":"CRDB Bank","details":{...},"amount":700000}
-- 2. Cash: {"type":"Cash","details":{...},"amount":700000}

-- Simple Format Payments:
-- 1. Cash: "cash" (100 TSH)

-- ✅ RECOMMENDATIONS:

-- 1. Payment Method Standardization:
-- Consider standardizing on simple format for better performance
-- Use: "Cash", "CRDB Bank", "NMB Bank", "Mobile Money", "Card"

-- 2. Data Consistency:
-- Your data shows both JSON and simple payment formats
-- This is working but could be standardized for better analytics

-- 5. All queries executing successfully

-- ✅ NEXT STEPS:

-- 1. Continue using the working query patterns
-- 2. Monitor for any new 400 errors
-- 3. Consider standardizing payment method formats
-- 4. Use the patterns from SUPABASE-400-ERROR-SOLUTION.sql for new features

-- ✅ FILES TO REFERENCE:

-- 1. SUPABASE-400-ERROR-SOLUTION.sql - Main solution file
-- 2. TEST-400-ERROR-FIX.sql - Test queries
-- 3. PAYMENT-METHODS-ANALYSIS.sql - Payment method analysis
-- 4. WORKING-QUERIES-IMMEDIATE.sql - Working query patterns

-- ✅ MONITORING:

-- To prevent future 400 errors:
-- 1. Always use simple queries with minimal nesting
-- 2. Avoid complex joins in the select parameter
-- 3. Use separate API calls for complex data requirements
-- 4. Test queries in Supabase dashboard before implementing
-- 5. Use the browser network tab to monitor query performance

-- ✅ EMERGENCY FALLBACK:

-- If you encounter any new 400 errors, use this ultra-simple query:
-- SELECT * FROM lats_sales ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
-- Then fetch related data in separate queries as needed.

-- ✅ SUCCESS CONFIRMATION:

-- Your 400 error fix is working perfectly:
-- 1. Sales data is loading successfully
-- 2. Customer information is displaying correctly
-- 3. Payment methods are working properly
-- 4. Sales summary is functioning
-- 5. No more 400 Bad Request errors
