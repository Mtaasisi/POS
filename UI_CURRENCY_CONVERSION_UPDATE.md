# UI Currency Conversion to TZS - Update Summary

## ✅ What Was Done

I've updated the payment UI to automatically display currency conversion to TZS for purchase order payments!

---

## 🎨 UI Updates

### Payment Modal Enhancement

The `PaymentsPopupModal` component now shows:

1. **Original Amount** - In the purchase order's currency
2. **Exchange Rate Display** - Shows the conversion rate (e.g., "1 USD = 2,500 TZS")
3. **TZS Equivalent** - The converted amount in TZS
4. **Clear Message** - "Payment will be processed in TZS"

## 📸 What Users Will See

When making a payment on a purchase order with foreign currency:

```

## 🔄 How It Works

### For TZS Purchase Orders
- Shows amount in TZS only
- No conversion needed

### For Foreign Currency Purchase Orders
- Shows original amount (e.g., $100 USD)
- Shows exchange rate (e.g., 1 USD = 2,500 TZS)
- Shows TZS equivalent (e.g., ≈ TZS 250,000)
- Clear message that payment will be processed in TZS

## ✨ User Experience

### Before:
```
Amount to Pay: $100 USD
[No indication it will be converted to TZS]
```

### After:
```
Amount to Pay: $100 USD

Currency Conversion
Exchange Rate: 1 USD = 2,500 TZS
≈ TZS 250,000
Payment will be processed in TZS
```

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Transparency** - Users see exactly how much will be paid in TZS
2. **Clarity** - Exchange rate is displayed clearly
3. **No Surprises** - Users know the payment will be in TZS before confirming
