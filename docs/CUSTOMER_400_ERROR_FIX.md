# Customer API 400 Error Fix

## Problem

The application was experiencing 400 Bad Request errors when fetching customer data from Supabase. These errors were occurring in multiple functions:

- `fetchCustomersPaginated`
- `fetchCustomerById`
- `searchCustomers`
- `loadCustomerDetails`

## Root Cause

The 400 errors were caused by **trying to select a `whatsapp` column that doesn't exist in the customers table**. The problematic queries were trying to select:

```typescript
// ❌ This was causing 400 errors
.select(`
  id, name, email, phone, gender, city, joined_date, loyalty_level, color_tag, referred_by, total_spent, points, last_visit, is_active, birth_month, birth_day, referral_source, total_returns, profile_image, created_at, updated_at, created_by, location_description, national_id, last_purchase_date, total_purchases, birthday, whatsapp
`)
```

## Solution

### 1. Removed Non-Existent Column

Removed the `whatsapp` column from all customer select queries since it doesn't exist in the database:

```typescript
// ✅ This works without 400 errors
.select(`
  id, name, email, phone, gender, city, joined_date, loyalty_level, color_tag, referred_by, total_spent, points, last_visit, is_active, birth_month, birth_day, referral_source, total_returns, profile_image, created_at, updated_at, created_by, location_description, national_id, last_purchase_date, total_purchases, birthday
`)
```

### 2. Files Updated

The following files were updated to remove the `whatsapp` column from select queries:

- `src/lib/customerApi.ts` - `fetchCustomersPaginated` and `loadCustomerDetails` functions
- `src/lib/customerApi/core.ts` - `performFetchAllCustomers` and `fetchCustomerById` functions  
- `src/lib/customerApi/search.ts` - `searchCustomers` function

### 3. Type Definition Note

The `whatsapp` field is still defined in `src/types.ts` as an optional field, but it's not actually stored in the database. This is fine as it doesn't affect the queries, but the field will always be undefined when fetching from the database.

## Testing

After applying these fixes, the customer fetching functions should work without 400 errors. The application should be able to:

- Load customer lists without errors
- Search customers successfully
- Display customer details properly
- Handle pagination correctly

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Always verify that columns exist in the database before including them in select queries
2. Use database schema validation tools
3. Test queries in development before deploying to production
4. Monitor API error logs for 400 Bad Request errors
