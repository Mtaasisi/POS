# Real-Time Subscription Fix

## Issue Summary

The real-time subscription was failing with a "CLOSED" status immediately after connecting successfully. The diagnostic revealed:

1. **Initial connection successful** ✅ (`SUBSCRIBED` status)
2. **Immediate disconnection** ❌ (`CLOSED` status)
3. **Infinite loop in subscription handling** ❌ (Maximum call stack size exceeded)

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by:
- **Rapid reconnection attempts** without proper cooldown periods
- **Infinite loops in subscription handlers** due to recursive unsubscribe calls
- **Aggressive event handling** without proper error boundaries
- **Missing connection state management** leading to race conditions

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in Event Handlers
```typescript
// Before
(payload) => this.handleStockMovement(payload.new)

// After  
(payload) => {
  try {
    this.handleStockMovement(payload.new);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('❌ Error in stock movement handler:', error);
  }
}
```

### 2. Improved Safe Unsubscribe Method
- Added recursive call prevention with `_unsubscribing` flag
- Better null checks and error handling
- Prevented infinite loops in unsubscribe operations

### 3. Connection Cooldown Implementation
```typescript
// Check connection cooldown to prevent rapid reconnection attempts
const now = Date.now();
if (now - this.lastConnectionAttempt < this.connectionCooldown) {
  console.log('⏳ Connection cooldown active, skipping initialization');
  return;
}
```

### 4. Delayed Retry Logic
```typescript
// Add delay before retry to prevent rapid reconnection attempts
setTimeout(() => {
  if (!this.isConnected && !this.isInitializing && !this.isDisconnecting) {
    this.handleConnectionFailure();
  }
}, 1000);
```

### 5. Reduced Supabase Client Load
```typescript
realtime: {
  params: {
    eventsPerSecond: 5, // Reduced from 10 to prevent overload
  },
  reconnectAfterMs: (tries) => Math.min(tries * 2000, 30000), // Slower reconnection
}
```

### 6. Enhanced Debug Information
- Added detailed connection status reporting
- Improved error logging with specific cause identification
- Added health check functionality

## Testing

### Diagnostic Script
Run the diagnostic script to test the fix:
```bash
node scripts/test-realtime-fix.js
```

### Manual Testing
1. Open the POS page
2. Check the Real-Time Status Debug panel
3. Click "Test Connection" to verify functionality
4. Click "Health Check" to verify Supabase connectivity

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Initial Connection**: Should connect successfully and stay connected
2. **Error Handling**: Errors in event handlers won't crash the subscription
3. **Reconnection**: Should reconnect gracefully with proper delays
4. **Stability**: No more infinite loops or stack overflow errors

## Monitoring

The enhanced debug panel now shows:
- Connection status (Enabled/Connected/Initializing)
- Retry count and maximum retries
- Last heartbeat timestamp
- Channel ID for debugging
- Health check results

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor the application** for 24-48 hours to ensure stability
2. **Check browser console** for any remaining subscription errors
3. **Verify real-time updates** are working correctly in the POS system
4. **Consider implementing** additional monitoring if needed

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. **Check network connectivity**
2. **Verify Supabase service status**
3. **Clear browser cache and refresh**
4. **Check browser console for errors**
5. **Run the diagnostic script again**

## Files Modified

- `src/features/lats/lib/realTimeStock.ts` - Main service improvements
- `src/features/lats/components/RealTimeStatusDebug.tsx` - Enhanced debugging
- `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` - Improved client configuration
- `scripts/test-realtime-fix.js` - New test script
- `scripts/fix-realtime-subscription.js` - Diagnostic script

## Configuration

The real-time service now uses these improved settings:
- **Max retries**: 3 (reduced from 5)
- **Connection timeout**: 5 seconds
- **Cooldown period**: 10 seconds between connection attempts
- **Events per second**: 5 (reduced from 10)
- **Reconnection delay**: Exponential backoff with 2-second base
