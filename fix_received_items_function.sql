-- Fix for missing get_received_items_for_po function
-- This resolves the "receive form remains empty" issue

-- Drop existing function if it exists with different signature
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_received_items_for_po(UUID);

-- Create the get_received_items_for_po function with correct return type
