# Console Errors Fix Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes all the console errors found in your application logs and provides solutions for each issue.

3. Verify the fix works

## 2. WhatsApp Real-time Connection Issues

whatsappService.ts:393 üî¥ WhatsApp real-time subscription closed
WhatsAppWebPage.tsx:315 üìä Message status update: {type: 'subscription', status: 'disconnected'}
```

### Root Cause
WhatsApp real-time subscriptions are being disconnected and reconnected frequently, which is normal behavior but can be optimized.

### Solution
