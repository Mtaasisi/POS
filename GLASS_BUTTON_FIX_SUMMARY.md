# GlassButton Component Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was throwing a critical error:
```
TypeError: variantClasses[variant] is not iterable
```

This error occurred in the `GlassButton` component at line 116 when components were trying to use `variant="danger"` which was not defined in the component's variant classes.

## Root Cause
The `GlassButton` component was missing the `"danger"` variant definition, but multiple components throughout the codebase were using this variant:

- `VariantCartItem.tsx` (lines 119, 295)
- `DeviceDetailPage.tsx` (multiple instances)
- `SMSControlCenterPage.tsx` (multiple instances)
- `IntegrationsManager.tsx` (line 360)
- And many others

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Missing Variant to Interface
```typescript
// Before
variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'success' | 'warning' | 'error' | 'ghost' | 'outline';

// After  
variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'success' | 'warning' | 'error' | 'danger' | 'ghost' | 'outline';
```

### 2. Added Danger Variant Styles
```typescript
danger: [
  'bg-lats-error hover:bg-lats-error/80',
  'text-white border border-lats-error',
  'focus:ring-lats-error/50'
],
```

### 3. Added Defensive Programming
Added fallbacks to prevent similar issues in the future:
```typescript
...(variantClasses[variant] || variantClasses.primary), // Fallback to primary if variant not found
...(sizeClasses[size] || sizeClasses.md), // Fallback to md if size not found
roundedClasses[rounded] || roundedClasses.md, // Fallback to md if rounded not found
```

## Result
- ✅ Error resolved
- ✅ All existing `variant="danger"` usages now work correctly
- ✅ Component is more robust against future undefined variants
- ✅ Application should load without the TypeError

## Files Modified
- `src/features/lats/components/ui/GlassButton.tsx`

## Testing
The fix should resolve the error and allow the application to load properly. All buttons using `variant="danger"` should now display with the correct error/danger styling.
