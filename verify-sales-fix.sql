-- VERIFY SALES FIX: Test the exact queries that were failing
-- This confirms the 400 Bad Request error is resolved

-- 1. Test the complex query that was causing 400 errors
SELECT 'Testing complex sales query...' as status;

-- This is the exact query format that was failing in the frontend
SELECT 
    ls.id,
    ls.sale_number,
    ls.customer_id,
    ls.customer_name,
    ls.customer_phone,
    ls.total_amount,
    ls.payment_method,
    ls.status,
    ls.created_by,
    ls.created_at,

    lp.name as product_name,
    lp.description as product_description,
    lpv.name as variant_name,

LEFT JOIN lats_products lp ON lsi.product_id = lp.id
LEFT JOIN lats_product_variants lpv ON lsi.variant_id = lpv.id
ORDER BY ls.created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- 2. Test the Supabase REST API query format
SELECT 'Testing Supabase REST API format...' as status;

-- This simulates what Supabase REST API would generate
SELECT 
    ls.*,
    c.name as customer_name,

LEFT JOIN lats_products lp ON lsi.product_id = lp.id
LEFT JOIN lats_product_variants lpv ON lsi.variant_id = lpv.id
ORDER BY ls.created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- 3. Test simple query (fallback)
SELECT 'Testing simple fallback query...' as status;

SELECT * FROM lats_sales 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;

-- 4. Final verification
