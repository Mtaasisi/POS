- `src/components/LocalImageUpload.tsx` - Upload component
- `src/components/LocalImageGallery.tsx` - Gallery component
- `server-upload-handler.php` - PHP upload handler
- `add-local-path-to-product-images.sql` - Database migration
- `setup-local-storage.sh` - Server setup script
- `test-local-storage.html` - Test verification page
- `src/pages/LocalStorageTestPage.tsx` - React test page

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps for Full Deployment**

### **1. Server Setup (Required)**
```bash
# Run on your hosting server
chmod +x setup-local-storage.sh
./setup-local-storage.sh
```

### **2. Database Migration (Required)**
```sql
-- Execute in your database
-- Run: add-local-path-to-product-images.sql
```

### **3. Configure Upload Handler (Required)**
Update `server-upload-handler.php` with your database credentials:
```php
$dbConfig = [
    'host' => 'your-database-host',
    'dbname' => 'your-database-name',
    'username' => 'your-username', 
    'password' => 'your-password'
];
```

### **4. Test the System**
- Upload `test-local-storage.html` to your server
- Access the test page to verify everything works
- Or use the React test page: `LocalStorageTestPage`
