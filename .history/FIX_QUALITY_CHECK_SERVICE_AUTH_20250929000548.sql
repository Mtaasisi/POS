-- FIX QUALITY CHECK SERVICE AUTHENTICATION
-- =====================================================
-- This script fixes the authentication issue in the quality check service
-- The service is using 'system' as checked_by but RLS policies expect auth.uid()

-- =====================================================
-- 1. UPDATE RLS POLICIES TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE
-- =====================================================

-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "quality_checks_select_policy" ON purchase_order_quality_checks;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "quality_checks_insert_policy" ON purchase_order_quality_checks;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "quality_checks_update_policy" ON purchase_order_quality_checks;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "quality_checks_delete_policy" ON purchase_order_quality_checks;

-- Create more flexible policies that work with both authenticated users and system calls
CREATE POLICY "quality_checks_select_policy" 
ON purchase_order_quality_checks

USING (
    -- Allow if user owns the purchase order OR if it's a system call

    )
);

-- 2. ALTERNATIVE: DISABLE RLS TEMPORARILY FOR TESTING
-- =====================================================

-- Uncomment the line below to temporarily disable RLS for testing
-- ALTER TABLE purchase_order_quality_checks DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 3. VERIFY POLICIES
-- =====================================================

-- Check the new policies
