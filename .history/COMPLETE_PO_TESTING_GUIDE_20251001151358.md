    SUM(qci.quantity_passed) as total_passed
FROM lats_purchase_orders po
LEFT JOIN purchase_order_quality_checks qc ON po.id = qc.purchase_order_id
LEFT JOIN purchase_order_quality_check_items qci ON qc.id = qci.quality_check_id
LEFT JOIN inventory_items ii ON ii.metadata->>'purchase_order_id' = po.id::TEXT
WHERE po.id = 'YOUR_PO_ID'
GROUP BY po.id, po.order_number;
```

- ‚úÖ Correct amount deducted from TZS account
- ‚úÖ Conversion note added to payment
- ‚úÖ Payment recorded in account currency

---

## üîç Data Integrity Checks

### After Each Test Run:

```sql
-- 1. Check for orphaned records
SELECT 'Orphaned PO Items' as issue, COUNT(*)
FROM lats_purchase_order_items poi
LEFT JOIN lats_purchase_orders po ON poi.purchase_order_id = po.id
WHERE po.id IS NULL;

-- 2. Check for negative balances
SELECT 'Negative Account Balances' as issue, COUNT(*)
FROM finance_accounts
WHERE balance < 0;

-- 3. Check for quality checks without items
SELECT 'Quality Checks Without Items' as issue, COUNT(*)
FROM purchase_order_quality_checks qc
LEFT JOIN purchase_order_quality_check_items qci ON qc.id = qci.quality_check_id
WHERE qci.id IS NULL AND qc.status = 'completed';

-- 4. Check for inventory items without PO metadata
SELECT 'Inventory Items Missing PO Link' as issue, COUNT(*)
FROM inventory_items
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
AND (metadata->>'purchase_order_id' IS NULL OR metadata->>'purchase_order_id' = '');

-- 5. Check for payment mismatches
SELECT 
    'Payment Mismatches' as issue,
    po.order_number,
    po.total_amount,
    COALESCE(SUM(pop.amount), 0) as total_paid,
    po.total_amount - COALESCE(SUM(pop.amount), 0) as difference
FROM lats_purchase_orders po
LEFT JOIN lats_purchase_order_payments pop ON po.id = pop.purchase_order_id AND pop.status = 'completed'
WHERE po.status = 'received'
GROUP BY po.id, po.order_number, po.total_amount
HAVING po.total_amount - COALESCE(SUM(pop.amount), 0) != 0;
```

---

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Items not appearing in Received tab
**Symptoms:** Quality check completed, but Received tab shows 0 items

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check if items are in inventory with PO metadata
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM inventory_items 
WHERE metadata->>'purchase_order_id' = 'YOUR_PO_ID';

-- If 0, click "Receive to Inventory" button in Quality Check Summary
-- Or run manually:
SELECT receive_quality_checked_items(
    'QUALITY_CHECK_ID',
    'PO_ID',
    'USER_ID'
);
```

---

### Issue 2: Payment fails with "Insufficient balance"
**Symptoms:** Payment rejected even though account has balance

**Solution:**
1. Check account currency matches payment currency
2. If different, ensure exchange rate is configured
3. Verify account balance is sufficient after conversion

---

### Issue 3: Cannot complete PO
**Symptoms:** "Complete" button disabled or fails

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check completion status
SELECT * FROM check_purchase_order_completion('YOUR_PO_ID');

-- Look for items with unmatched quantities
SELECT 
    p.name,
    poi.quantity as ordered,
    poi.received_quantity as received,
    poi.quantity - poi.received_quantity as pending
FROM lats_purchase_order_items poi
JOIN lats_products p ON poi.product_id = p.id
WHERE poi.purchase_order_id = 'YOUR_PO_ID'
AND poi.quantity != poi.received_quantity;
```

---

### Issue 4: Quality Check modal crashes
**Symptoms:** Error on line 147 about `.slice()` on undefined

**Solution:**
- Already fixed! Quality check ID validation added
- If still occurs, check browser console for specific error
- Ensure quality check ID is valid before opening modal

---

## üöÄ Automation Opportunities

Consider automating these tests:
1. Create PO with API
2. Process payment
3. Receive items
4. Verify inventory items created
5. Check data integrity queries

**Tools:** Playwright, Cypress, or custom scripts using Supabase client

---

## üìû Support

If tests fail or issues persist:
1. Run `COMPLETE_PO_SYSTEM_FIX.sql`
2. Check database logs in Supabase dashboard
3. Review browser console errors
