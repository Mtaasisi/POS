# Payment Currency Conversion to TZS - Summary

## Overview
The payment system has been updated to **automatically convert all foreign currency payments to TZS** before processing. This ensures consistency in payment records and simplifies accounting.

---

## üîß What Was Fixed

### 1. **Ambiguous Column Reference Error** ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: `column reference "exchange_rate" is ambiguous`
- **Fix**: Removed the unused local `exchange_rate` variable that was conflicting with the table column

### 2. **Currency Conversion to TZS** ‚úÖ
- **New Behavior**: All payments are now converted to TZS and stored in TZS
- **How it works**:
  - If payment is in foreign currency (USD, EUR, etc.), it's multiplied by the exchange rate to get TZS
  - If payment is already in TZS, it's used as-is
  - The original currency and amount are preserved in the `reference` and `notes` fields

---

## üí° How It Works

### Example Scenario:
**Purchase Order**: $1,000 USD (Exchange Rate: 2,500 TZS/USD)

**Payment Process**:
1. User enters: **$100 USD** payment
2. System converts: **$100 √ó 2,500 = 250,000 TZS**
3. System stores: **250,000 TZS** in the database
4. System adds note: *"Converted from 100.00 USD to 250000.00 TZS using rate 2500.0"*
5. Account balance is deducted accordingly

## üìä Payment Record Fields

After conversion, payment records include:

| Field | Value | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `amount` | 250000.00 | Converted TZS amount |
| `currency` | TZS | Always stored as TZS |
| `reference` | "Original: 100.00 USD" | Preserves original amount |
| `notes` | "Converted from 100.00 USD to 250000.00 TZS using rate 2500.0" | Full conversion details |

## ‚ú® Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All payments stored in TZS for easy reporting
2. **Transparency**: Original currency preserved in notes
3. **Accuracy**: Uses purchase order exchange rate for conversions
4. **Error Prevention**: Validates exchange rate exists before converting
5. **Audit Trail**: Full conversion details in audit log

## üîç Key Features

### Currency Conversion Logic
```
IF payment_currency != 'TZS':
    amount_in_tzs = payment_amount √ó exchange_rate
ELSE:
    amount_in_tzs = payment_amount
```

### Balance Checking
- Account balance is converted to TZS for comparison
- Ensures sufficient funds regardless of account currency

### Account Deduction
- If account is in TZS: deduct TZS amount directly
- If account is in foreign currency: convert TZS back to account currency for deduction

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Exchange Rate Required**: Foreign currency payments require a valid exchange rate on the purchase order
2. **Error Handling**: System raises an exception if exchange rate is missing for foreign currency
3. **Backward Compatible**: TZS payments work exactly as before
4. **Audit Trail**: All conversion details are logged in `purchase_order_audit` table

## üéØ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Payment in TZS (should work as before)
- [ ] Payment in USD with exchange rate (should convert to TZS)
- [ ] Payment in EUR with exchange rate (should convert to TZS)
- [ ] Payment in foreign currency without exchange rate (should fail with clear error)
- [ ] Check payment record shows TZS amount
- [ ] Check notes contain conversion details
- [ ] Verify account balance deducted correctly

## üìù Example Payment Flow

### Before (Old System)
```
Payment: $100 USD
Stored: $100 USD
Issue: Mixed currencies in database
```

### After (New System)
```
Payment: $100 USD
Exchange Rate: 2,500
Converted: 250,000 TZS
Stored: 250,000 TZS
Note: "Converted from 100.00 USD to 250000.00 TZS using rate 2500.0"
Result: Consistent TZS records ‚ú®
```

## ü§ù Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that purchase orders have valid exchange rates
