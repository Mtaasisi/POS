-- CHECK PO STATUS AND FIX RECEIVE FUNCTION
-- =====================================================
-- This checks the current status of the specific PO and fixes the receive function

-- Step 2: Check all purchase orders to see what statuses exist
SELECT 
    'All PO Statuses:' as message,
    status,
    COUNT(*) as count

-- Step 3: Check if the PO exists at all
