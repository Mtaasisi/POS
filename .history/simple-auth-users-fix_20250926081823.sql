-- SIMPLE FIX FOR AUTH_USERS 400 ERROR
-- This script demonstrates the correct query patterns without modifying the table

-- 1. Test the correct query patterns that work
SELECT 
    'Testing correct query patterns' as step;

-- ✅ CORRECT: Query by name (this is what you should use instead of id=in.(care))
SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    email,
    username,
    role
FROM auth_users 
WHERE name = 'care';

-- ✅ CORRECT: Query by email
SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    email,
    username,
    role
FROM auth_users 
WHERE email = 'care@example.com';

-- ✅ CORRECT: Query by role
SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    email,
    username,
    role
FROM auth_users 
WHERE role = 'technician';

-- ✅ CORRECT: Query multiple names
SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    email,
    username,
    role
FROM auth_users 
WHERE name IN ('care', 'admin', 'technician');

-- 2. Show the difference between wrong and correct approaches
SELECT 
    '❌ WRONG: id=in.(care) - causes 400 error' as wrong_approach,
    '✅ CORRECT: name=care - works properly' as correct_approach;

-- 3. Success message
SELECT 
    '✅ SOLUTION: Replace .in("id", ["care"]) with .eq("name", "care") in your JavaScript code' as solution;
