-- FINAL FIX FOR get_received_items_for_po FUNCTION
-- This will fix the remaining "structure of query does not match function result type" error

-- Drop the problematic function
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_received_items_for_po(UUID);

-- Create the corrected get_received_items_for_po function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_received_items_for_po(po_id UUID)
