# Quality Check Items Display - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 **Objective**
Show quality-checked items on the purchase order page so users can understand what's already been checked and its status.

## ✅ **What Was Fixed**

### 1. **Added Quality Check Items State**
- Added `qualityCheckItems` state to store quality check item details
- Added `isLoadingQualityCheckItems` state for loading indicator

### 2. **Fetch Quality Check Items on Received Tab**
When the "Received" tab is accessed, the page now:
- Loads received items (as before)
- **NEW:** Loads quality check summary
- **NEW:** Loads detailed quality check items with results

### 3. **Display Quality Checked Items**
Created a new section that shows:
- **Product Information:** Product name and variant
- **Check Criteria:** What was checked (e.g., "Physical Condition", "Functionality")
- **Quantity Checked:** How many units were inspected
- **Status Badge:**
  - ✅ **Green "Passed"** - Shows quantity passed
  - ❌ **Red "Failed"** - Shows quantity failed  
  - ⏳ **Yellow "Pending"** - Items not yet checked
- **Notes:** Any additional notes from quality check

### 4. **Improved User Guidance**
Updated the "No received items" message to be context-aware:
- If quality check items exist: Shows "Quality check completed! Click 'Receive to Inventory' button above to add these items to inventory"
- If no quality check: Shows default message

## 📊 **What You'll See Now**

### On the Received Tab:
1. **Quality Check Summary** (top)
   - Shows total items, passed, failed, pending
   - Green "Receive to Inventory" button

2. **Quality Checked Items** (new section)
   - Lists all 7 quality-checked items
   - Shows 5 items with "Passed" badge (green)
   - Shows 2 items with "Pending" badge (yellow)
   - Clearly indicates what's been checked and what hasn't

3. **Search & Filters** (below)
   - Filter received items by status, location, etc.

4. **Received Items Table** (bottom)
   - Currently empty (waiting for items to be received)
   - Will populate after clicking "Receive to Inventory"

## 🔄 **Workflow Now Clear**

### Step-by-Step Process:
1. ✅ **Quality Check Complete** - 5 items passed, 2 pending
2. 👀 **View Results** - See exactly what was checked in "Quality Checked Items" section
3. 📦 **Receive to Inventory** - Click green button to add passed items
4. ✅ **Items in Inventory** - Items appear in "Received Items" table below

## 💡 **Key Benefits**

✅ **Transparency** - Users can see exactly what's been quality checked  
✅ **Status Clarity** - Color-coded badges show pass/fail/pending at a glance  
✅ **Action Guidance** - Clear message on what to do next  
✅ **Audit Trail** - See criteria checked and any notes  

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Run the SQL function** (if not done yet):

   - Run in Supabase SQL Editor

2. **Test the Flow**:
   - Go to Purchase Order page
   - Click "Received" tab

## 📁 **Files Modified**

1. `/src/features/lats/pages/PurchaseOrderDetailPage.tsx`
   - Added quality check items state and loading
   - Fetch quality check items when received tab loads
   - Display quality check items with status badges
   - Updated empty state message

2. `/src/features/lats/services/qualityCheckService.ts`
   - Already has `getQualityCheckItems()` method (used now)

3. `/src/features/lats/components/quality-check/QualityCheckSummary.tsx`
