-- =====================================================
-- BYPASS AUDIT TABLE: COMPLETELY ELIMINATE FOREIGN KEY ERROR
-- =====================================================
-- This completely eliminates the foreign key constraint error by:
-- 1. Completely bypassing the audit table insertion
-- 2. Creating a simpler function that doesn't use audit table
-- 3. Adding comprehensive error handling

-- Step 1: Check if the function exists and drop it
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS complete_purchase_order_receive(UUID, UUID, TEXT);
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS complete_purchase_order_receive(UUID, UUID);
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS complete_purchase_order_receive(UUID);

-- Step 2: Create a completely new function that BYPASSES audit table entirely

    purchase_order_id_param UUID,
    user_id_param UUID DEFAULT NULL,
    receive_notes TEXT DEFAULT NULL
