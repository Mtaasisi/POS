## üö® Important Notes

### Before Running
1. **Backup your database** - Always backup before making changes
2. **Test in development first** - Don't run directly in production
3. **Review the scripts** - Understand what each script does

### After Running
1. **Test your application** - Verify all sales operations work
2. **Check user permissions** - Ensure users have proper access
3. **Monitor system health** - Use the dashboard views
4. **Review audit logs** - Check that operations are being logged

## üîç Verification Steps

### 1. Check Authentication
```sql
SELECT * FROM get_current_user_info();
```

### 2. Test Sales Access
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM lats_sales;
```

### 3. Check System Health
```sql
SELECT * FROM system_dashboard;
```

### 4. View System Status
```sql
SELECT * FROM authentication_system_status;
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### If you get errors:
1. **Check Supabase logs** - Look for specific error messages
2. **Verify user permissions** - Ensure you're authenticated
3. **Check RLS policies** - Verify policies are properly created
4. **Review audit logs** - Check for operation failures

### Common Issues:
- **401 errors persist**: Check if RLS policies are enabled
- **Permission denied**: Verify user has proper role
- **Function errors**: Check if all functions were created successfully
