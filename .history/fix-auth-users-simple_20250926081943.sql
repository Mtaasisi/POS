-- SIMPLE FIX FOR AUTH_USERS 400 ERROR
-- This version avoids constraint issues by using a simpler approach

-- 1. Check current auth_users table structure
SELECT 
    'Checking auth_users table structure' as step;

SELECT 
    column_name,
    data_type,
    is_nullable,
    column_default
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'auth_users'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- 2. Check existing users
SELECT 
    'Current users in auth_users table' as step;

SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    email,
    username,
    role,
    is_active,
    created_at
FROM auth_users
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- 3. Test the correct query patterns
SELECT 
    'Testing correct query patterns' as step;

-- ✅ CORRECT: Query by name (this is what you should use instead of id=in.(care))
SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    email,
    username,
    role
FROM auth_users 
WHERE name = 'care';

-- ✅ CORRECT: Query by email
SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    email,
    username,
    role
FROM auth_users 
WHERE email = 'care@example.com';

-- ✅ CORRECT: Query by role
SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    email,
    username,
    role
FROM auth_users 
WHERE role = 'technician';

-- ✅ CORRECT: Query multiple names
SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    email,
    username,
    role
FROM auth_users 
WHERE name IN ('care', 'admin', 'technician');

-- 4. Create test data if needed (simple approach without constraints)
-- Check if users exist and insert only if they don't
INSERT INTO auth_users (name, email, username, role, is_active)
SELECT 'care', 'care@example.com', 'care', 'technician', true
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM auth_users WHERE name = 'care');

INSERT INTO auth_users (name, email, username, role, is_active)
SELECT 'admin', 'admin@example.com', 'admin', 'admin', true
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM auth_users WHERE name = 'admin');

INSERT INTO auth_users (name, email, username, role, is_active)
SELECT 'technician', 'tech@example.com', 'technician', 'technician', true
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM auth_users WHERE name = 'technician');

-- 5. Final verification queries
SELECT 
    'Final verification - all queries should work' as step;

-- Test all correct patterns
SELECT 'Query by name' as test_type, COUNT(*) as result_count
FROM auth_users WHERE name = 'care'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Query by email', COUNT(*)
FROM auth_users WHERE email = 'care@example.com'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Query by role', COUNT(*)
FROM auth_users WHERE role = 'technician'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Query multiple names', COUNT(*)
FROM auth_users WHERE name IN ('care', 'admin', 'technician');

-- 6. Success message with solution
SELECT 
    '✅ AUTH_USERS 400 ERROR FIX COMPLETED!' as status,
    'SOLUTION: Replace .in("id", ["care"]) with .eq("name", "care") in your JavaScript code' as solution,
    'The error was caused by trying to use string "care" as UUID in id field' as explanation;
