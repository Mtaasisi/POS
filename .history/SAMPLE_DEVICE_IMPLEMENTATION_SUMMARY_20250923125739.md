- **Repair Cost**: TZS 15,000 (internal cost)
- **Repair Price**: TZS 25,000 (customer price)
- **Deposit Amount**: TZS 10,000 (upfront payment)

## üîß **Database Schema Requirements**

The following columns must exist in the `devices` table:
- `repair_cost` (NUMERIC)
- `repair_price` (NUMERIC)
- `deposit_amount` (NUMERIC)

**Migration Files Available:**
- `supabase/migrations/20250131000016_add_repair_price_to_devices.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/20250131000056_add_missing_device_fields.sql`
- `fix_device_payment_schema.sql` (combined fix)

## üöÄ **Workflow Progress**

The sample device is currently progressing through the repair workflow:

1. ‚úÖ **assigned** ‚Üí **diagnosis-started** (COMPLETED)
2. ‚è≥ **diagnosis-started** ‚Üí **in-repair** (NEXT)
3. ‚è≥ **in-repair** ‚Üí **reassembled-testing**
4. ‚è≥ **reassembled-testing** ‚Üí **repair-complete**
5. ‚è≥ **repair-complete** ‚Üí **process-payments** (NEW STEP)
6. ‚è≥ **process-payments** ‚Üí **returned-to-customer-care**
7. ‚è≥ **returned-to-customer-care** ‚Üí **done**

## üí∞ **Sample Device Pricing Examples**

| Device | Issue | Repair Cost | Customer Price | Deposit | Profit |
|--------|-------|-------------|----------------|---------|--------|
| iPhone 12 Pro | Screen replacement | 45,000 TZS | 65,000 TZS | 20,000 TZS | 44% |
| Galaxy S21 | Battery replacement | 25,000 TZS | 40,000 TZS | 15,000 TZS | 60% |
| P30 Pro | Camera repair | 35,000 TZS | 55,000 TZS | 18,000 TZS | 57% |
| Redmi Note 10 | Charging port | 15,000 TZS | 25,000 TZS | 10,000 TZS | 67% |
| OnePlus 8T | Back glass | 30,000 TZS | 50,000 TZS | 20,000 TZS | 67% |

## üîç **Verification Steps**

### **1. Check Database Schema**
Run this SQL query in your Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'devices' 
AND column_name IN ('repair_cost', 'repair_price', 'deposit_amount')
ORDER BY column_name;
```

### **2. Test Sample Device Creation**
1. Click the "Sample Device" button
2. Verify the success message shows pricing information
3. Check that the device appears in the device list with pricing

### **3. Test Payment Workflow**
1. Continue the device workflow to "repair-complete"
2. Verify pending payments are created automatically
3. Test the payment processing modal
4. Verify payment validation before handover

## üéØ **Next Steps**

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. **Verify Database Schema**: Ensure pricing columns exist
2. **Test Complete Workflow**: Progress the sample device through all statuses
3. **Test Payment Processing**: Verify the payment workflow works end-to-end

### **Long-term Benefits:**
1. **Realistic Testing**: Sample devices now provide complete testing scenarios
2. **Payment Integration**: Seamless integration with the payment system
3. **Profit Tracking**: Clear visibility into repair costs vs. customer prices
4. **Cash Flow Management**: Proper deposit handling for business operations
