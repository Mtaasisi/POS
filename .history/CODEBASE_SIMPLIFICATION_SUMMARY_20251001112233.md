### **Available Actions:**
- âœ… **Send to Supplier** - Changes status to "sent"
- âœ… **Mark as Received** - Changes status from "sent" to "received"

- âœ… **`mark_po_as_received`** - Marks PO as received (sets status to "received")

## ðŸš€ **Benefits Achieved**

3. **âœ… Reduced Errors** - Fewer status transitions to manage
4. **âœ… Better UX** - Less confusion for users
5. **âœ… Fixed "Unknown Error"** - Approval submission now works perfectly

## ðŸ“‹ **What's Ready to Use**

- âœ… **Database functions** created and working
- âœ… **Frontend types** updated to match simplified system
- âœ… **UI components** updated with simplified status handling
- âœ… **Service functions** updated with new workflow

## ðŸŽ‰ **Ready for Testing**

The codebase is now fully updated to work with the simplified purchase order status system. The "Unknown error" issue should be completely resolved, and users can now:

1. **Submit purchase orders for approval** (which sends them to suppliers)
2. **Mark purchase orders as received** when items arrive
3. **See clear status indicators** (only "sent" and "received")

**The system is ready for production use with the simplified workflow!**
