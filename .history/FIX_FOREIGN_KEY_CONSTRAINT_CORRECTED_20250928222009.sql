-- =====================================================
-- CORRECTED FIX: FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINT ERROR IN RECEIVE FUNCTION
-- =====================================================
-- This fixes the "violates foreign key constraint purchase_order_audit_user_id_fkey" error
-- and handles the missing created_at column issue

-- Step 1: Check current audit table structure
SELECT 
    'Current audit table structure:' as message,
    column_name,
    data_type,
    is_nullable,
    column_default
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'purchase_order_audit' 
AND table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- Step 2: Make user_id column nullable to avoid foreign key constraint violations
ALTER TABLE purchase_order_audit 
ALTER COLUMN user_id DROP NOT NULL;

-- Step 3: Check current users in the system
SELECT 
    'Current Users in auth.users:' as message,
    id,
    email,
    created_at
FROM auth.users 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;

-- Step 4: Check current authenticated user
SELECT 
    'Current authenticated user:' as message,
    auth.uid() as current_user_id,
    CASE 
        WHEN auth.uid() IS NULL THEN 'No authenticated user'
        WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM auth.users WHERE id = auth.uid()) THEN 'User exists'
        ELSE 'User does not exist in auth.users'
    END as user_status;

-- Step 5: Create the complete_purchase_order_receive function with proper user_id handling
-- and without created_at column (since it doesn't exist)
