# Sample Device Button - Pricing Integration Update

## üéØ **Overview**
Updated the sample device creation functionality to include realistic repair pricing information, making it easier to test the payment workflow and pricing system.

## ‚úÖ **Changes Made**

### **1. Enhanced Sample Device Data**
Updated both `DevicesPage.tsx` and `AdminManagementPage.tsx` to include comprehensive pricing information:

#### **Sample Devices with Pricing:**
- **Apple iPhone 12 Pro**: Repair Cost: 45,000 TZS, Price: 65,000 TZS, Deposit: 20,000 TZS
- **Samsung Galaxy S21**: Repair Cost: 25,000 TZS, Price: 40,000 TZS, Deposit: 15,000 TZS  
- **Huawei P30 Pro**: Repair Cost: 35,000 TZS, Price: 55,000 TZS, Deposit: 18,000 TZS
- **Xiaomi Redmi Note 10**: Repair Cost: 15,000 TZS, Price: 25,000 TZS, Deposit: 10,000 TZS
- **OnePlus 8T**: Repair Cost: 30,000 TZS, Price: 50,000 TZS, Deposit: 20,000 TZS

#### **Pricing Structure:**
- **Repair Cost**: Internal cost to perform the repair
- **Repair Price**: Price charged to customer (includes profit margin)
- **Deposit Amount**: Upfront payment required from customer

### **2. Enhanced Success Messages**
Updated success notifications to display pricing information:
```
Sample device created: Apple iPhone 12 Pro - Repair: TZS 65,000, Deposit: TZS 20,000 - Assigned to John Doe
```

### **3. Database Integration**
Updated `deviceApi.ts` to properly handle pricing fields:
- Added `repair_cost`, `repair_price`, and `deposit_amount` to database queries
- Updated device creation to include pricing information
- Fixed field mapping between frontend and database

### **4. Currency Formatting**
Added proper Tanzanian Shilling (TZS) currency formatting for display:
```typescript
const formatCurrency = (amount: number) => {
  return new Intl.NumberFormat('en-TZ', {
    style: 'currency',
    currency: 'TZS',
    minimumFractionDigits: 0
  }).format(amount);
};
```

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Files Modified:**
1. `src/features/devices/pages/DevicesPage.tsx`
2. `src/features/admin/pages/AdminManagementPage.tsx`
3. `src/lib/deviceApi.ts`

### **Database Schema Requirements:**
The following columns must exist in the `devices` table:
- `repair_cost` (DECIMAL)
- `repair_price` (DECIMAL) 
- `deposit_amount` (DECIMAL)

*Note: Run the `fix_device_payment_schema.sql` file to add these columns if they don't exist.*

## üéÆ **How to Use**

### **Creating Sample Devices:**
1. Navigate to the Devices page or Admin Management page
2. Click the "Sample Device" button
3. A random device will be created with realistic pricing
4. The success message will show the pricing information
5. The device will be assigned to the tech@tech.com technician

### **Testing Payment Workflow:**
1. Create a sample device using the button
2. Navigate through the repair workflow
3. When the device reaches "repair-complete" status, pending payments will be automatically created
4. Use the payment processing modal to test payment collection
5. Verify payment validation before device handover

## üí∞ **Pricing Examples**

| Device | Issue | Repair Cost | Customer Price | Deposit | Profit Margin |
|--------|-------|-------------|----------------|---------|---------------|
| iPhone 12 Pro | Screen replacement | 45,000 TZS | 65,000 TZS | 20,000 TZS | 44% |
