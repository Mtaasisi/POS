4. **Check browser console** for any errors
5. **Verify database records** are created

### 🔧 **Potential Issues to Check:**

1. **Button Visibility** - Quality Control button might not be visible
2. **Status Conditions** - Button might only show for specific PO statuses
3. **User Permissions** - RLS policies might block certain users
4. **Data Loading** - Purchase order items might not be loading correctly

### 📋 **Next Steps:**

1. **Test the UI** - Try accessing the Quality Control modal
2. **Check Console** - Look for any JavaScript errors
3. **Verify Data** - Ensure purchase order items are loaded
4. **Test Actions** - Try creating quality check records

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior:**

2. **Verify user authentication** and permissions
3. **Check network requests** in browser dev tools
4. **Ensure purchase order has items** to quality check
5. **Verify RLS policies** are working correctly

The frontend connection appears to be properly implemented and should work with the backend fixes we've made!
