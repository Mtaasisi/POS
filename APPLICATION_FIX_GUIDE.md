# CUSTOMER DATA FETCHING ISSUE - FIX GUIDE

## Problem Identified:
Your application is showing:
- Total Spent: Tsh 0 (should be Tsh 29,396,000)
- Orders: 0 (should be 129)
- Points: 29396 (correct)
- Devices: 0 (correct)
- Calls: 0 (correct)

## Possible Causes:

### 1. Database Update Not Applied
- The SQL update hasn't been run in your database yet
- Solution: Run COMPLETE_CUSTOMER_UPDATE.sql in your database

### 2. Application Cache Issue
- Your application might be caching old data
- Solution: Clear application cache or restart the application

### 3. Database Connection Issue
- Application might be connecting to wrong database
- Solution: Check database connection settings

### 4. Column Name Mismatch
- Application might be looking for different column names
- Solution: Check if application uses 'total_spent' vs 'totalSpent'

## Quick Fixes:

### Fix 1: Run Database Update
```sql
UPDATE customers SET
    total_spent = 29396000,
    total_purchases = 129,
    points = 29396,
    loyalty_level = 'platinum'
WHERE phone = '25564000186';
```

### Fix 2: Check Application Code
Look for these field mappings in your application:
- total_spent → totalSpent
- total_purchases → totalPurchases or orders
- loyalty_level → loyaltyLevel

### Fix 3: Clear Cache
- Restart your application server
- Clear browser cache
- Clear any application cache
