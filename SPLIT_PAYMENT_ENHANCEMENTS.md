# Split Payment Display Enhancements

## Overview
Enhanced the payment management system to show detailed information for split/multiple payments instead of just displaying "Multiple" as a generic label.

## What Was Enhanced

### 1. PaymentDetailsViewer Component
**File**: `src/features/payments/components/PaymentDetailsViewer.tsx`

**Enhancements**:
- **Split Payment Breakdown Section**: Shows detailed information for each payment method used
- **Individual Payment Cards**: Each payment method is displayed in its own card with:
  - Payment method icon and name
  - Amount for that specific method
  - Account information (if available)
  - Reference numbers
  - Card details (last 4 digits)
  - Mobile numbers
  - Bank names
  - Timestamps
  - Notes
- **Summary Statistics**: Shows total payments, number of payment methods, and total amount
- **Enhanced Single Payment Display**: Even single payments now show more detailed information

### 2. PaymentTrackingDashboard Component
**File**: `src/features/payments/components/PaymentTrackingDashboard.tsx`

**Enhancements**:
- **Split Payment Preview**: Shows a preview of split payments in the payment list
- **Method Count**: Displays how many payment methods were used
- **Individual Method Amounts**: Shows each method and its amount
- **Total Summary**: Displays the total amount for split payments

## Data Structure Support

The system already supports split payments with this structure:
```typescript
paymentMethod: {
  type: 'multiple', // or single method name
  details: {
    payments: [
      {
        method: 'cash',
        amount: 50000,
        accountId: 'account-123',
        reference: 'REF-001',
        notes: 'Partial cash payment',
        timestamp: '2024-01-15T10:30:00Z'
      },
      {
        method: 'card',
        amount: 100000,
        accountId: 'account-456',
        reference: 'REF-002',
        cardLast4: '1234',
        timestamp: '2024-01-15T10:31:00Z'
      }
    ],
