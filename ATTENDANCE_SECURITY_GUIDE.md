# Attendance Security System Guide

## Overview

The Attendance Security System implements multiple layers of verification to prevent fraudulent check-ins and ensure employees are physically present at the office. This system prevents common attendance fraud scenarios such as:

- **Remote check-ins** from home or other locations
- **Proxy check-ins** where someone else checks in for an employee
- **Time manipulation** attempts
- **Location spoofing** using fake GPS

## Security Layers

### üîí **1. Location Verification (GPS)**

#### **How It Works**
- Uses device GPS to verify physical location
- Compares current coordinates with office location
- Calculates distance using Haversine formula
- Considers GPS accuracy in verification

#### **Security Features**
- **Real-time GPS**: Cannot be spoofed easily
- **Accuracy consideration**: Accounts for GPS margin of error
- **Configurable radius**: Office can set allowed distance (e.g., 100m)
- **High accuracy requirement**: Uses `enableHighAccuracy: true`

#### **Prevents**
- ‚úÖ Remote check-ins from home
- ‚úÖ Check-ins from other cities/locations
- ‚úÖ Basic GPS spoofing attempts

#### **Limitations**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Advanced GPS spoofing (requires technical knowledge)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Employees near office but not inside

---

### üì∂ **2. Network Verification (WiFi)**

#### **How It Works**
- Detects connected WiFi network
- Compares with approved office networks
- Verifies network SSID and BSSID (router MAC)
- Requires connection to office WiFi

#### **Security Features**
- **Network whitelist**: Only approved networks allowed
- **BSSID verification**: Checks router MAC address
- **Real-time detection**: Cannot fake network connection
- **Multiple networks**: Supports multiple office locations

#### **Prevents**
- ‚úÖ Check-ins from home WiFi
- ‚úÖ Mobile data check-ins
- ‚úÖ Public WiFi check-ins
- ‚úÖ Network spoofing attempts

#### **Limitations**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires WiFi infrastructure
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Employees must have network access

---

### üì∑ **3. Photo Verification (Selfie)**

#### **How It Works**
- Requires employee to take a selfie
- Uses device camera for real-time photo
- Can integrate with face recognition (optional)
- Stores photo with timestamp for audit

#### **Security Features**
- **Real-time capture**: Cannot use pre-taken photos
- **Camera access**: Requires device camera permissions
- **Timestamp verification**: Photo taken at check-in time
- **Identity verification**: Can compare with employee photo

#### **Prevents**
- ‚úÖ Proxy check-ins by others
- ‚úÖ Using old photos
- ‚úÖ Automated check-ins
- ‚úÖ Identity theft attempts

#### **Limitations**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires camera permissions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Lighting/quality dependent
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Twins or similar-looking people

## Multi-Factor Security Process

### **Step-by-Step Verification**

1. **Location Check** üìç
   - Employee clicks "Check In"
   - System requests GPS location
   - Verifies distance from office
   - Must be within configured radius

2. **Network Check** üì∂
   - System detects WiFi connection
   - Compares with office network list
   - Verifies network credentials
   - Must be on approved network

3. **Photo Check** üì∑
   - Employee takes selfie
   - System captures photo with timestamp
   - Optional face recognition verification
   - Photo stored for audit trail

4. **Final Verification** ‚úÖ
   - All three checks must pass
   - System logs verification data
   - Attendance recorded with security metadata

## Configuration Options

### **Office Location Setup**

```javascript
officeLocation: {
  lat: -6.2088,        // Office latitude
  lng: 39.2083,        // Office longitude
  radius: 100,         // Allowed radius in meters
  address: "123 Main Street, Dar es Salaam"
}
```

### **Network Configuration**

```javascript
officeNetworks: [
  {
    ssid: "Office_WiFi",
    bssid: "00:11:22:33:44:55",  // Router MAC address
    description: "Main office network"
  },
  {
    ssid: "Office_Guest",
    description: "Guest network"
  }
]
```

### **Security Levels**

| Level | Location | Network | Photo | Use Case |
|-------|----------|---------|-------|----------|
| **Basic** | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Simple location verification |
| **Standard** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | Office network required |
| **High** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Full security (recommended) |
| **Custom** | ‚öôÔ∏è | ‚öôÔ∏è | ‚öôÔ∏è | Configurable per employee |

## Conclusion

The Attendance Security System provides comprehensive protection against fraudulent check-ins while maintaining a user-friendly experience. By combining multiple verification methods, the system ensures that only employees who are physically present at the office can successfully check in.

The multi-layered approach makes it extremely difficult for employees to bypass security measures, while the configurable options allow organizations to implement the level of security that best fits their needs.

For maximum security, we recommend implementing all three verification layers (Location + Network + Photo) and regularly reviewing security logs and configurations.
